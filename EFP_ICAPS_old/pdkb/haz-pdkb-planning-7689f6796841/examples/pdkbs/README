A .pdkb file is made up of 1+k+1 lines where the first line is of the form:

<depth> <# of agents> <propositions>

...and the next k lines is a set of amls, one per line, and the final line is:

END

An example PDKB file:
2 2 p,q
B1 q
B1 B2 !q
END

Assumptions:

* <propositions> should be comma separated and contain no spaces.
-- Examples: p,q,r  or  hot,cold,foo

* <# of agents> should be less than 10 (to keep the parsing simple)

* You can't use 'B' as a proposition (it makes parsing ambiguous)

* The amls can contain spaces, but should only use 'B', '!',
  the numbers 1-9, and propositions.
-- Examples: B1B2p  or  B2 !B1 foo
