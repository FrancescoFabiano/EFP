Refactor:

- Reintroduce original (EFP 2.1) parsing of the problem and original (EFP 2.1) transition function
- Check the various capabilities (from the shell command) of the planner and remove the ones that are not useful
- Add the E-PDDL parsing (through a script)
- Remove useless files (such as optimized_poss)
- Check if Kripke structures and possibilities are on the same level (Probably we need to make the new transition function templatic)
- Update the README
- Design simple interface

- Check Planning graph and make it work with old transition function
- Make planning graph able to work with the general Transition function

- Algorithm portfolio-like management of planner characteristics
