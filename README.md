# EFP

## Goal
Realize an Epistemic Forward Planner that bases its concept on different states representations such as:
- [x] *Kripke structure*
- [ ] *possibilities* and exploits *dynamic programming*.
- [ ] *OBDDs*

## The situation:
- We have PG-EFP, an epistemic forward planner based on Kripke structure that also uses epistemic planning graph.
  
## Future works
- Encode the concept of possibility;
- Prepare for dynamic programming exploiment.

- Think about OBDDs.

- Allow the planner to work with every the representation.

- Heuristics.

## Theorical ideas to study
- Objective vs subjective common knowledge;
- announcemt/sensing of Belief formulae;
- ontic that remove uncertanty;
- static laws (the same as biased info?);
- intial state;
- false beliefs correction.


- Lies and biased info;
- ethic constraints.
