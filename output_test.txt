EFP version 2.0 - Built date: Thu Oct 19 18:13:35 MDT 2023
The planner will check for visited states
The States are represented with Possibilities (NWF-SET).  (Default)
The solving process will run heuristics in parallel using forked processes. 
The planner will conclude once the fastest parallel process has concluded computation. (Default)
